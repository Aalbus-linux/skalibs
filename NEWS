Changelog for skalibs.

In 2.5.0.1
----------

 - Bugfix release.


In 2.5.0.0
----------

 - Added this NEWS file. :)
 - Dropped support for old versions of OpenBSD (at least 4.9 isn't working
anymore). Newer versions are still supported: 5.7 and up are working.
 - --enable-replace-libc flag dropped. All supported systems now have a
compliant-enough libc for skalibs' purposes.
 - Major types overhaul to be more POSIXly correct. 64-bit operations are
now supported on 64-bit archs where int is 32-bit. Use of POSIX types
wherever important, e.g. where pointers are used: datastruct.h indices,
for instance, are uint32_t. stralloc et al. lengths are size_t.
 - Related API changes: skalibs/ushort.h, skalibs/uint.h and skalibs/ulong.h
have disappeared - replaced with skalibs/types.h that also includes basic
fmtscan support for common POSIX types. The uint16, uint32 and uint64
integer types have disappeared - replaced with stdint.h types. uint64_t is
defined by skalibs/uint64.h when stdint.h omits it.
 - Lots of minor bugfixes and cleanups related to the types system.
 - Better support for getrandom() and arc4random().
